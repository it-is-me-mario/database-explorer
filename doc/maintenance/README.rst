Explorer maintenance
====================

The application, its source-specific collection pipelines and published aggregate
snapshots belong here. The MARIO library owns parsers and accounting methods.
Use its released public API where possible and record the exact version.

The initial extraction is pinned in ``source-manifest.json``. Existing classification
and numerical snapshots preserve upstream provenance and all source restrictions.
Changes to classifications that affect MARIO's packaged concordances require a
separate reviewed update in the library repository. A website update does not
silently change the library's frozen runtime bundles.

The literal parser recipes are frozen from that same upstream commit and their
checksum is stored in ``source-manifest.json``. The explorer can collect from
those reviewed literals without copying the library's walkthrough pages. A
changed snapshot must be refreshed from reviewed MARIO sources, rather than
silently accepting a stale or missing notebook. ``database_catalogue --prepare``
belongs to the upstream notebook workflow; do not use it to regenerate recipes
from the explorer-only page tree.

Trade observations
------------------

Collect one database and year at a time. Include intermediate and final use once.
Keep native regions and components in private extraction reports, validate against
MARIO ``calc_trades``, and publish only aggregate observations with source units,
price basis, year and geography. Currency conversion requires an observed annual
exchange rate and compatible price basis. Hybrid physical units are never summed.

Comtrade merchandise exports and mirror imports are separate observations. Retain
valuation, aggregation/reporting flags, source query and retrieval time. Use cached,
rate-limited API calls. No API request is made by a visitor or an ordinary build.
Review redistribution conditions before expanding original-data downloads.

Verification and publication
----------------------------

Run focused pipeline/model tests, a strict Sphinx build, and local-link/download
checks. Inspect desktop/mobile layouts where the browser environment permits it.
Do not claim a visual review from DOM or structural checks alone.

GitHub Pages is deployed independently of MARIO releases. Verify the deployment
commit and public content. Configure the custom domain only after its DNS target
is verified. The library's old URLs remain available until a separate migration PR
is reviewed and merged; any administrator exception is specific to that PR.


Integrated comparison browser
----------------------------

Trade belongs to the shared Indicator selector in Compare databases. Its pure
aggregation and chart adapters live in ``trade-model.js`` and ``trade-charts.js``;
``economy-browser.js`` owns the shared filters, views, notes and downloads.
Keep the former Trade URL as a redirect to ``compare.html#trade``. Test switching
back to economic indicators as well as direct entry through that fragment.

Group comparisons require complete individual-country coverage on each native
reading. Remove domestic country pairs before aggregation, including overlapping
origin/destination sets. Aggregate each complete Comtrade reporting side before
forming bounds; never sum pairwise minima/maxima or partial reporting coverage.
The all-sector MRIO scope and merchandise-only reference must remain visible.
References are contextual, with no accuracy ratio, and are hidden when only one
use component is displayed. Check legend visibility as well as dropdown changes.

For this totals-only release, preserve sector controls for other indicators but
disable the Trade sector picker. Offer the native all-sector total and the
existing goods-producing-group proxy as distinct scopes, with unknown proxies
unavailable. A shared concordance lookup does not imply a
numerical HS-to-industry allocation. Do not introduce sector estimates silently.

The browser regression is ``npm run test:browser`` after building ``_site``.
Install Node dependencies with ``npm ci`` and a test browser with
``npx playwright install chromium``. Set ``EXPLORER_PREVIEW_URL`` to test an
existing local or public preview; otherwise the checker starts its own loopback
server. ``EXPLORER_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome`` uses an existing Chrome installation.
Screenshots go to a temporary QA directory, never published data assets.
Check annual legend toggles before and after resizing, observed-year labels,
missing groups, scope changes and restoration of economic filters when switching
back from Trade.
